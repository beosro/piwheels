piwheels is Python package repository providing `wheels`_ (pre-built binaries)
for the ARMv6 and ARMv7 architectures used by `Raspberry Pi`_.

This repository contains the source code for building armv6 and armv7 wheels
for packages found on `PyPI`_, and the project's future will be discussed in
`GitHub issues`_.

The piwheels service is hosted at `www.piwheels.org`_.

Usage
-----

`Raspbian Stretch`_ includes configuration for pip to use piwheels by default.
If you're using an alternate distribution, make sure you have pip v9, and you
can use piwheels by placing the following lines in ``/etc/pip.conf``::

    [global]
    extra-index-url=https://www.piwheels.org/simple

Alternatively, install from piwheels explicitly with ``-i`` or
``--index-url``::

    sudo pip3 install numpy -i https://www.piwheels.org/simple

or ::

    sudo pip3 install numpy --index-url https://www.piwheels.org/simple

Or as an additional index::

    sudo pip3 install numpy --extra-index-url https://www.piwheels.org/simple

Support
-------

piwheels provides wheels which are compatible with all Raspberry Pi models (Pi
3, Pi 2, Pi 1 and Pi Zero), for Python 3.4 and 3.5. We plan to add support for
Python 3.6 and 2.7.


Issues
------

If you find any issues with packages installed from piwheels, please open a new
issue in `GitHub issues`_, providing as much detail as possible.
